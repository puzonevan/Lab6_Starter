{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Recipe","name":"Chicken Teriyaki","description":"Teriyaki is derived from the Japanese root words \u003ci\u003eteri\u003c/i\u003e, to shine, and \u003ci\u003eyaki\u003c/i\u003e, to broil or grill. Thatâ€™s the way traditional teriyaki looks: shiny and incised with grill marks. In Japan, teriyaki is a mix of soy sauce, sake and the rice wine mirin, which imparts a subtle sweetness. The teriyaki found throughout Seattle, of which this is an adaptation, is a bit more showy. Cooks sweeten with white sugar and pineapple juice. They thicken with cornstarch. Ginger and garlic go into the mix because of the Korean ancestry of many cooks. It is not at all traditional, but it is simple to prepare and addictive to eat. Be sure to plan ahead as you do need to marinate the chicken before cooking. An overnight stay in the fridge is ideal, but many readers have been happy with a quick marinade of an hour or so.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John T.
